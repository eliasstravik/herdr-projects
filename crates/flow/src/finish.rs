//! The finish line: commit, check, push, draft pull request, review, then the approval gate. Never merges by itself
//! unless `merge.by` says `itself` (finish/auto_merge.rs). Runs in a detached runner, started by the event hook when
//! herdr says the agent stopped, so it works with the board closed. One step per file in finish/.
