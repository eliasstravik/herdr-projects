//! How much can be handed to a program through herdr, and the files that carry what is longer. A start command is typed
//! into the pane's shell, and a terminal takes at most 4096 bytes on one line while that shell is still starting (its
//! line editor not yet up): a longer one arrives cut off, the shell waits at its continuation prompt and herdr times out
//! (seen on herdr 0.9.3 with Codex's rules in `-c developer_instructions=…`). A message is one argument of `herdr agent
//! prompt`, and Linux takes at most 128 KiB in one argument.
